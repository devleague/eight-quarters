# Eight-Quarters

An logic exercise to find the least amount of times you can split 8 quarters and find the odd-one-out.

### Installation

`npm install` for dependencies

### How to use

```
node index.js
```

You will receive two prompts: *Left Scale* and *Right Scale* in which you will "digitally" place your quarters numbered from 1 to 8 on top to check which is heavier. Find the quarter that is the odd one out! You have 3 tries. Try to do it in 2!

On the third try, the quarters will mix itself up forcing you to start again.
